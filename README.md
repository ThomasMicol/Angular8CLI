# Clickster

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.1.0.

This site was made as a practice for use of the angular CLI as well as practice with angular version 8.1 which is what we are migrating to for work. 

Goal of the site is to let the user be able to click mindlessly for money, then  spend that money on randomly generated upgrades. Upgrades increase the amount you gain from clicking. 
Upgrade costs should scale with how much money you are making so that it doesnt become too easy.
UI isnt a priority but a nice to have feature would be to do the entire ui nicely in css grid for further practice with that technology.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
